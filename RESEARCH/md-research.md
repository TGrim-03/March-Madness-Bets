# Research Report
## Markdown Extended Research
### Summary of Work
<!--One paragraph summary of the research being performed-->

My research involved looking up Markdown guides and tutorials in order to better improve my documentation abilities, as well as to set a standard for Markdown documentation, such as for the README, for the rest of the project. I understand this did not directly contribute to the app development, but since my current issues revolved around Markdown anyway, I figured it was worth the time. After going through and practicing the various resources, I applied a number of formatting techniques that I learned to the tasks I had this Sprint involving Markdown files. 
### Motivation
<!--Explain why you felt the need to perform this research-->

I researched this topic because I felt that I wasn't updating documentation for the README or SKELETON in the most presentable and informative way. I furthered my understanding of Markdown beyond the in-class tutorial. 
### Time Spent
<!--Explain how your time was spent-->
I spent about 60 minutes researching and practicing Markdown. I largely spent my time looking up tutorials and familiarizing myself with their contents. 
### Results
<!--Explain what you learned/produced/etc. This section should explain the
important things you learned so that it can serve as an easy reference for yourself
and others who could benefit from reviewing this topic. Include your sources as
footnotes. Make sure you include the footnotes where appropriate e.g [^1]-->

After this research, I now have a more comprehensive understanding about how to use Markdown more effectively for documentation purposes. I hope to use what I've learned in the rest of the project.
